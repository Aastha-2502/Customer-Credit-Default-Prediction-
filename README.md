## Credit Default Prediction.


 This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the process of building a decision tree model for credit decision-making. It includes techniques for data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation, using the following steps:

- Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset, explore its structure, and understand the distribution of features.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features to prepare the data for modeling.
- Model Training: Build and train a decision tree model using scikit-learn, and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and visualize the decision tree.
- By following these steps, the notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for implementing a decision tree model to make credit decisions, ensuring the process is clear and reproducible.
